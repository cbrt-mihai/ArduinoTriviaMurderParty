## Backstory

  <p> Since the beginning of the project, when we were tasked to think about a game to build, I knew I had to create a different type of game than my colleagues, not to flex or anything, but to stand out. </p>
  <p> The inspiration for this game is a minigame from Jackbox, a game series with tons of party minigames. The minigame that inspired me, was the one named just like this one: "Trivia Murder Party", in which you have to answer different trivia questions in order to gain money and not die. The ones who answer wrong, are forced to play a selection of "lethal" minigames in order to survive. </p>

## Description

  <p> Trivia Murder Party is a minigame where you need to answer as many questions right, if you want to survive as long as possible. The game has two disting difficulties: easy and hard, for both the casual and the knowledgeable. Game topics range from anime and games, to geography and music, so that anyone can enjoy the game. </p>
